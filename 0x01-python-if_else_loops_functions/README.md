# 0x01 Python - if/else, loops, functions :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers the loop statements if, else

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the while and for loops
* How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
* How to use the break and continues statements
* How to use else clauses on loops
* What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
* How to use range
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does return a function that does not use any return statement
* Scope of variables
* What’s a traceback
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative
1. Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
2. Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase
3. Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase,
4. Program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
5. Program that prints numbers from 0 to 99
6. Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. Function that checks for lowercase character.
8. Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. Function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. Function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13. Function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
14. Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase)
15. Function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n 
16. Function def magic_calculation(a, b, c)
